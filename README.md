# Description
Being a big friend of modularity and extensibility I found myself implementing the same crude plugin functionality over and over. Those days have ended with this library, as it allows me to leave the logic of actual plugin loading and caching to this library instead of handling it myself.
  
## Installation
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Narumikazuchi.Extensibility.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Narumikazuchi.Extensibility)  
The installation can be simply done via installing the nuget package or by downloading the latest release here from github and referencing it in your project.
